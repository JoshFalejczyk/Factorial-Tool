# Factorial-Tool

This is a small project I wrote in Summer 2020 in my spare time.  It is a Ruby implementation of a program that given user input, computes and outputs factorials of any range.  I am aware of its simplicity (computing factorials should not take many lines of code anyway), however this just stands as a basic test of my skills in Ruby as I continue to teach and familiarize myself with the language.  Though not large in the amount of lines of code, this program was written to extend across multiple introductory concepts in Ruby like classes, if-statements, loops, and I/O.

To Run (on Bash): 
1. Run using "ruby factorial.rb"
2. Enter factorial requests by user input as desired.
3. Exit program execution by inputting "-1".

Credit: 
1. The concept for this program and all of the code within it was written by myself.
